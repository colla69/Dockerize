It was released on March 29, 2004 by Nuclear Blast. The album was criticized by longtime fans for its modern sound and the band further forsaking its original melodic death metal roots. However, the album was seen by many as a natural progression from Reroute to Remain and was critically praised in many areas of the press such as Metal Hammer and Kerrang!. Soundtrack to Your Escape reached number 3 in Sweden. In the USA it peaked at number 145 on the Billboard 200 (their first album to reach the Billboard 200), number 2 on the Top Heatseekers chart, and number 7 on the Independent Albums charts.\n\nThe album was available in both a regular jewel case release featuring 12 tracks, and a limited edition digipak with a bonus track, Discover Me Like Emptiness.
