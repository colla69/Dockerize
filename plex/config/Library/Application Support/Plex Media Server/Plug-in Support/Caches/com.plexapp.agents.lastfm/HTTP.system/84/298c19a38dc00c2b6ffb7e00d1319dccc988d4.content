Recorded and produced at Studio Fredman by Fredrik Nordström, it was released on July 25th, 2000 through Nuclear Blast. It features lineup: frontman Anders Fridén, guitarists Jesper Strömblad & Björn Gelotte, bassist Peter Iwers and Daniel Svensson on drums. It also features additional programming and synthesizers by Charlie Storm. Guitarist Christopher Amott guest features on track \"Suburban Me\". All music was composed by Jesper Strömblad and Björn Gelotte, with lyrics by Anders Fridén.\n\nMost of the lyrics deal with depression and other internal struggles. The album's cover artwork was made by German artist Axel Hermann, and it is based on famous Renaissance painter Leonardo da Vinci's drawing, “the Vitruvian Man”. The Jester Head mascot also appears in the background, both on the cover and inside the album booklet. Photography was shot by Tobias Lundgren.\n\nMusic videos were shot for tracks “Pinball Map”, directed by Tamara Jordan; and “Only for the Weak”, with Metal Hammer magazine naming the latter one of its “Top 10 Melodic Death Metal Songs”. In 2005, Clayman was ranked at number 448 in German RockHard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/In+Flames/Clayman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
