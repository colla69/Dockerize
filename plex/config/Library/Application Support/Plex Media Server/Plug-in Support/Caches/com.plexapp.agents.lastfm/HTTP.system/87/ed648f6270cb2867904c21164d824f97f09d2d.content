This is the first album recorded by In Flames without founding guitarist Jesper Strömblad, who left the band in February 2010  making it also the first In Flames release not to have two guitarists. According to Anders, this album features increasingly wide vocal registers and reduced growls. In addition, some of the album's songs \"pretty much go against the hard rock formula.\" The entire album was written by Björn Gelotte. The guitar solos, unlike most other albums, were able to be pre-planned out and worked much better according to the in-studio report. Sounds of a Playground Fading received positive reviews. It debuted at number 27 on the US Billboard 200 album chart; number 2 on the Top Hard Rock Chart, number 7 on the Top Rock Chart and number 5 on the Top Independent Chart. It also debuted at Number 1 of the Billboard German Albums chart, and at Number 12 of the Billboard Canadian Albums chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/In+Flames/Sounds+of+a+Playground+Fading\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
