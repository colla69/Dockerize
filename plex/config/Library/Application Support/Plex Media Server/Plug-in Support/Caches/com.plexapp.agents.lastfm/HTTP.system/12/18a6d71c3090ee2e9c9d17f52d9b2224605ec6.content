The album saw a major change in musical style and was In Flames' first considerable step in the direction of mainstream music, and was met with rejection among many of their fanbase. It is sometimes viewed as a transitional album between Clayman and Soundtrack to Your Escape. The album's more accessible sound attracted many new fans and popularized In Flames' name within the US metal scene, helping to secure a top spot at Ozzfest. In 2005, Reroute to Remain was ranked number 326 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time. The album peaked at #13 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. This was the band's first album to present singles which were Trigger and Cloud Connected. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/In+Flames/Reroute+to+Remain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
